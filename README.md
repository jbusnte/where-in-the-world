## Where in the World

This is a web-based game that allows users to select a region and guess the country of a given city. The user is presented with a city and a list of country options. They need to make the correct guess within a limited number of rounds, currently 5. The score is calculated based on the number of correct guesses.

All country and city data comes from [Opendatasoft API](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/geonames-all-cities-with-a-population-1000/information/?disjunctive.cou_name_en&sort=name)
